# FS_LS_MoC1D
FS and LS MoC 1D code to facilitate the determination of order of accuracy of flat source and linear source approximations. 

The FS- and LS- MoC should really be what Multiphysics work bases on, even though Multiphysics work happened before these codes were sorted out. 

The MoC_LS_module.m and MoC_module.m will be massively resembly their counterparts in Multiphysics work.
